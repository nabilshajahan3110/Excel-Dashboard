Created by NABIL SHAJAHAN

As part of the #75 days of Data Analysis challenge, I created a dashboard based on a bikes sales dataset.
I created pivot tables, graphs, and charts covering different metrics such as occupation, marital status, childern count, commute distance, etc.
After that I systematically rearranged them to make a visually appealing and easy-to-use dashboard from which we can ascertain any data with a simple click.
